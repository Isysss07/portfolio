                    Hello, my name is Isyss Christerfield. I am a 9th grade student at Detroit School Of Arts. 
                    For the last month, Iâ€™ve been learning how to code with Journi. 
                     I've made made 5 finished projects. I've never done coding before.
                    Learning with journi has prepared me for my main dream job, which is to be a game developer. 
                </p>

            <h2> Dream Job</h2>
          
            <p class="col-md-7">
                I would love to be a game developer.
                One of the main reasons I want to work into the game industry is so I can showcase my visual arts skills. 
                It would be amazing to see my drawings in an actual. I also love coding; 
                I've always known that I loved drawing but now I want coding to be a part of my career.
                I learned more about coding and game development becuase my sister was interested in it. I realized I can still bring my characters to life sort of speak.

            <h2> Plans For The Future </h2>

            <p>
                In 2 years I  see myself as a necoming Juinor in high school. I'll still be woring on code too.
                In 5 years I see myself making chracater designs for my first game; I don't know if they'll be good but it's a start. 
                I will continue too seek out coding programs. There are a few programs that I already know like khan-academy and code-academy. 
               I just need to better my art and coding skills and I'll be set for the future.
